Every year I would normally spend it on something silly like makeup or handbags and the exciting time of my tax return in my bank account ends so much quicker because I spend it before it has the chance to sit in my bank account!

But this year I have been very disciplined with my money and decided I need to get my backside into gear and keep it into an emergency fund account and so the minute that return went into my account yesterday I popped it straight in my savings account never to be seen again!

I will say it feels really good to just have it straight into my savings and not spending it. It’s been a journey for me to really learn and understand money saving and how to live within my means with money but I am getting there! ♥️

d97bd490-7f6c-49b6-b35a-60bf696b4948,2022-02-05 04:59:15,"Hi. I’ve been floating around on this app for about a month & wanted to share.

I’m a sole parent and in 2014 I was rejected for a debt consolidation loan for $17k due to gas & electric bills I’d paid late (via debt collectors) when I’d moved.  That’s when I wanted to change the way I think about money.  It still took a couple more years to start paying off everything and get out of debts.

I’ve made a countless number of false starts, broken down and spent savings on “wants” and my budget has had more work than Cher (no shade, she’s an absolute Queen & admits she’s had work) … but now, 4 years later I’m finally down to paying out my last $1k & it’ll be cleared by mid 2029 at the latest, but likely well before.

In the last 13 years I’ve paid out & closed a personal loan & 7 credit cards & increased my Credit Score from a low 500 to a low 800.  I’ve also saved money & paid for items with cash - this past week alone my uncle needed new runners & my dishwasher died, and I paid cash for both from my savings & didn’t have to automatically buy the cheapest I could or use credit.  Last year I realised a lifelong dream and bought myself a bicycle, paying cash in full for the bicycle & safety gear.

I lived for years feeling terrified and ashamed of my debt, certain it would be with me for life & having anxiety attacks any time someone would talk money.  Now I’m building my emergency buffer, investing & having conversations with my son to set him on the right path.  I’m confident that if anything should happen to me, my son will be financially secure instead of half my piddling Super going to paying off my debts first.

On another note (for anyone still reading 🙃) a month ago, after struggling for years, I was diagnosed with stress.  stress is, in very simple terms, low recreation. Spending money on “things” for me was a massive dopamine hit, I spent SO MUCH every week on stuff I didn’t need.  My dopamine now comes from watching my financial situation improve (made even better with the WeMoney app!), and being able to provide my aunt her needs & her very occasional wants, and riding my bicycle.

We have had an increase in #NetWorth over the last 4 weeks 📈 💰!!

Overall we are $64214.04 ⬆️. This is a smaller increase than normal. Overall our share portfolio went down, as did our superannuation and hence a smaller growth this month. Buy hey, GROWTH is GROWTH 🙌.

Our landscaping is FINALLY done WOO HOO but we haven’t paid for it yet. However, our Net Worth will take a hit for the month of January when we part with $123. We will however have our home reappraised and fingers crossed we make the $12K back 🤞!

FOR REFERENCE:

✅ Short Terms Assets (STA) - Cash 💰

✅ Long Term Assets (LTA) - Superannuation, Home, Stock Portfolio & Bicycle (we are hoping to rent out our bicycle as another form of income, making it an asset)

❌ Liabilities - Home Loan & Credit Cards (which are always paid off each fortnight)

***STA + LTA - LIABILITIES = NET WORTH***

My investment journey started August 2020 and only now am I really taking it serious in terms of researching and finding what more I can do to help my goal of becoming financially independent. I haven't put a timeframe on that as of yet - still trying to get through the first stage of getting my budgeting and goals truly set.

I have been investing quarterly since in sort of lump sums I guess on IG. All of which have been good investments, most of which are ETF's. I'm now further exploring re-investing on a fortnightly basis on Pearler

On the otherhand of investing, I have been in the process of purchasing my first investment properly for maybe 6-7 months now. It has taken longer than my agent and I were hoping for but given our current situation (in Sydney), it's understandable. I'm going into property investment with my mum due to low income but the one big positive I am taking from the journey/experience so far is we have our deposit 💃🏼.
